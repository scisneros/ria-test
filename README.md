# Ria Money Transfer - Test

This project is a job application test for the company Ria Money Transfer. It is currently public but will be made private after evaluation.

It is made using Vue.js, with Vuetify for styles.

The required scope was achieved, except for the 5 days forecast, as at the time of developing the provided API key was not valid for the daily forecast API. Nonetheless, the frontend part was implemented, with those values hardcoded instead.

Bonus tasks (city search) were not implemented.

Total developing time was about 2:30hrs, not counting some breaks. I took a little more than expected because I was trying to workaround the API issue with local calculations based on available data, but ultimately decided it was not worth it.

## Running the project
**(Node.js required)**

Run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default, this will run on http://localhost:5173/. Index page will redirect to the first city available.
